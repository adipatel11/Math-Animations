## Understanding this Repository

Each project has its own folder. Inside of the folders are their respective main .py files. These can be run by themselves
and do not rely on other files in the directory.

## Background Information

I have relied on python turtle graphics in order to create these animations. I find that this specific module allows me to 
create projects quickly while sacrificing minimum quality. The methods of this module are straightforward, making them easy to 
remember. These benefits make this module ideal for my purposes. Also, many of the projects contain functions related to sin that
account for smooth color change. This makes the animations more appealing and pleasing to the eye.

## Information on Specific Projects

### Parametric Graphing Tool and Polar Graphing Tool

Inside of the main .py files of these projects, there exists r(Î¸) as well as f(t) and g(t). These functions can be changed
to graph different mathematical functions.
